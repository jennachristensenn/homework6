    "text": "Task 1: Conceptual Questions\n\nWhat is the purpose of the lapply() function? What is the equivalent purrr function?\n\n\nTo apply a function to every element of a list, The equivalent in purrr is map().\n\n\nSuppose we have a list called my_list. Each element of the list is a numeric data frame (all columns are numeric). We want use lapply() to run the code cor(numeric_matrix, method = “kendall”) on each element of the list. Write code to do this below!\n\n\nlapply(my_list, function(numeric_matrix) { cor(numeric_matrix, method = “kendall”)})\n\n\n\nWhat are two advantages of using purrr functions instead of the BaseR apply family?\n\n\n\nBase R has syntax inconsistencies and purr provides more functionality while also being cleaner.\n\n\nWhat is a side-effect function?\n\n\nIt changes the state of something such as printing out data or plotting. It does not transform the data, it produces something.\n\n\nWhy can you name a variable sd in a function and not cause any issues with the sd function?\n\n\nA temporary function environment is created when a function is called."
